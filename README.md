**Breast Cancer Prediction using Machine Learning**

This project builds a machine learning classifier to predict whether a tumor is **malignant** or **benign** using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.

Features:
- **Data Exploration & Visualization**: Understand feature distributions and identify skewness/outliers.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, encode the target variable, and standardize features.
- **Feature Selection**: Reduce multicollinearity to improve model performance.
- **Model Training & Evaluation**: Train and evaluate multiple classifiers including Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, and Decision Tree.

Results:
- **Best Model**: SVM achieved the highest test accuracy of **98.25%**, demonstrating strong generalization.

Next Steps / Improvements:
- Explore advanced models like **Random Forest**.
- Perform hyperparameter tuning and feature engineering for better performance.
- Investigate interpretability techniques to understand why the model makes certain predictions.
